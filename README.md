# 🔍 AI-Powered Information Extraction from P&ID Diagrams

This project is an AI-powered system that automatically extracts critical instrumentation and metadata from **Process and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs)** using a combination of **Computer Vision** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.

## 📌 Project Objective

To develop an AI system that can:
- Identify and interpret symbols, equipment, valves, and connections in P&ID diagrams
- Extract relevant specifications, process flows, and control loops
- Parse both scanned diagrams and CAD-based files
- Organize extracted data for integration into digital asset management or operational systems
